Creating your own SSHManager
----
Main SSH operations are in `bitvise.py`. To create your own, see the examples of usage in `examples` folder. To use it in your application, copy `bitvise.py`, `stnlc.exe` and all DLL files in `examples` folder to your project, import them and use as described in example codes.

Building your own
----
Doing this requires `Windows 8.1+`, `Python 3.9.5` so make sure to install them first to proceed to next steps.
